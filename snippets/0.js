// correction about procedural code: a procedure is a series of steps or actions bundled into a routine 
// (like a fn only with side effects and state mutations)  My claim that procedural code isn't good/scalable was ironic 
// considering some of the most sophisticated and complex systems are undoubtedly written in C and Fortran etc in a 
// procedural style (while I'm writing mainly clientside JS)

// I still maintain that imperative code is less readable, potentially more fragile, and most of all less reusable
// Since we are writing a higher level language, we can do better
// pure functional code should be extremely readable/reusable if done right
